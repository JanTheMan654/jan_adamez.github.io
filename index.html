		<h2>Javafx linked applications</h2>

            <p>Description: This project was created using javafx and scenebuilder. The purpose of this project was to link multiple projects previously worked on during the semester and have them work dynamically whenever switched onto. To switch to another program, it would be done via the file button at the top-left of the page. In the screenshot is one of the projects that displays buttons corresponding to the settings that are on the radio buttons. In the drop down box, is the option to highlight the buttons based on a preference (ex. even numbers, odd numbers, vowels, etc.).</p>

            <h2>Catering Services Website</h2>
            <p>This project's goal was to create a website where you sell a product or service. The website had to have a login and registration page. Only the home page was allowed to be accessible without a login. Every other page needed to be protected with a login requirement. I chose to make my service about a meal prep/catering service. The user was able to add three meal options into their cart and go through a checkout experience.</p>
